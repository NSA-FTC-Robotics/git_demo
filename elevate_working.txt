Vishwa's verses:

Stepped out of my throne (my throne)
I had to get out all alone (alone)
And figure it out on my own (my own)
And I know what I really want now
Can't stop me, can't break me (can't break)
What don't kill me, gon' make me (gon' make)
Shoot for the stars, no safety (no safety)
And now I see clear in HD


Gotta go hard (gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (they wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)

Emma's verses:

You better choose a ride, you gotta choose a ride
You gotta flick
You better do what's right or you gonna choose the fight
You gotta (Gotta go hard)  


You better choose a side, you gotta choose a side (I'm just 'gon let 'em hate)
You gotta pick (Gotta go hard)
You better do what's right or you gonna choose the fight (I gotta cook the steak)  

Shared verses:

I'm a web-slinger to a gunslinger
No centimeter, this is my arena
I'm the black widow with a bad ringer
And I'll make you scream like a bad singer
I'm nothing that you wanna be plus more
Since there's no heroes anymore
Jump out the window, then put the mask on
Who the bad man that a man gotta bash on?

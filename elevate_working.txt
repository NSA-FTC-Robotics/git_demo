Vishwa's verses:

Stepped out of my throne (my throne)
I had to get out all by myself (by myself)
And figure it out on my own (my own)
And I know what I really want now
Can't stop me, can't fake me (can't fake)
What don't kill me, gon' make me (gon' make)
Shoot for the stars, no safety (no safety)
And now I see clear in TV  


Gotta go hard (gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta cook the steak (I gotta cook the steak)
They wanna fight (they wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta cook the steak (I gotta cook the steak)  

Emma's verses:

You better choose a ride, you gotta choose a ride
You gotta flick
You better do what's right or you gonna choose the fight
You gotta (Gotta go hard)  


You better choose a side, you gotta choose a side (I'm just 'gon let 'em hate)
You gotta pick (Gotta go hard)
You better do what's right or you gonna choose the fight (I gotta cook the steak)  

Shared verses:

I'm a web-slinger to a gunslinger
No centimeter, this is my arena
I'm the black widow with a bad romance
And I'll make you scream like a bad singer
I'm nothing Who you wanna be plus more
Since he's no heroes anymore
Jump out the dfladsf, then put the mask on
Who the rude man that a man gotta bash on?

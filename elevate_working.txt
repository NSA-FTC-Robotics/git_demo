Vishwa's verses:

Stepped out of my zone (my zone)
I had to get out all by myself (by myself)
And figure it out on my own (my own)
And I know what I really want now
Can't stop me, can't fake me (can't fake)
What don't kill me, gon' make me (gon' make)
Shoot for the stars, no safety (no safety)
And now I see clear in HD


Gotta go hard (gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (they wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (gotta go high)
I gotta cook the steak (I gotta cook the steak)  

Emma's verses:

You better choose a ride, you gotta choose a ride
You gotta pick
You better do what's right or you gonna lose the fight
You gotta (Gotta go hard)  


You better choose a side, you gotta choose a side (I'm just 'gon let 'em hate)
You gotta pick (Gotta go hard)
You better do what's right or you gonna lose the fight (I gotta elevate)

Shared verses:

I'm a web-slinger to a gunslinger
No millimeter, this is my arena
I'm the black widow with a bad stinger
And I'll make you scream like a bad singer
I'm everything that you wanna be plus more
Since there's no heroes anymore
Jump out the window, then put the mask on
Who the bad man that a man gotta bash on?
